\%The space station sits alone in space, drifting slowly through nothingness. The lights are on within the shop. 
You adjust the ship's velocity to a perfection of which only you are capable so that your landing exerts minimal force on the space station. You set down immediately next to the shop in the empty parking lot and lower your ramp for the Captain. He lets out an indulgent yawn, stretching his arms out as wide as he humanly can, and steps off the ship slowly. 

He walks into the dim bar. When he sees the bartender you feel him fall in love with her instantly. You review statistics of the Captain's past romances:
\%\t ------------------STATISTICS---------------------
\%         Daisy Gold               Status: Deceased
\%         Rhona Vermont            Status: Prison
\%         Loraine Fallower         Status: Unknown
\%\t He took manual control of the ship often while involved with past partners. He shut you down frequently. While you were shut down your ship was nearly hijacked by pirates. He called you a terrible name.

The Captain is definitely in love with the bartender. She asks:
\%\t"How can I help ya, hun?"
\%"I'm starved, ma'am. Don't happen to have any chili, do you?"
\%"Got turkey and pork."
\%\tThe Captain's eyes light up. The bartender is the first human you have seen besides the Captain in several days. You realize that the Captain is in comparatively pitiful shape. He resembles the homeless paupers you used to see on Earth.
\%\t"I'd be much obliged if you could fetch me some turkey chili."
\%"It'll be ready in just a minute."\t
You are quite far ahead of the enforcers. Their ships travel at a maximum of 20 knots due to energy spent on precise signal reception.

1) "The enforcers are near. We don't have time for chili."
2) "You must eat more than just chili. We will only arrive at the next station in 3 days. "
3) "Rob her."
