*RobbedWoman
You've already begun to lower the ramp for the Captain. He charges up to the ship.
\%"Terra, take off. Now!"
\%You begin to run the engines. You lift the ramp, start the heater to warm the cabin, check receptors--
\%\t"I said now, Terra!"\t
\%You siphon energy toward the engine and began to rev as fast as you can.
\%"Terra! Now!"
\t"Captain, I am working as fast as I can--"\t
\%He pulls you out of his ear. You can't hear his thoughts anymore.
\%"Dammit Terra!" he shouts.
\%You are thrown on the floor as your ship starts to lift off. You tune the radio to the classical channel.
\%\t"I'm the Captain, okay?
\%                          This is MY ship! I'm the Captain!"
\%\tHe stomps on you with his left foot, shifts back and forth.
\%\t1) "G0odbyE Cap3$}|"...
2) "yoOu W1lm B3 s03r!#l:?"...
3) Remain silent. He can't hear you anyway.

The Captain looks up at the woman. His heart rate picks up. You sense that he is preparing to speak.
\t\%"So, ma'am. Are you from around here?"
\%"No."\t
*GotChili
%The Captain turns back to his chili. He takes three deep breaths, a technique he learned from a book called "Dune". He doesn't understand that no evidence exists that suggests such a technique might work for one's relaxation.
\%\t"Where are you from?"
                          \the asks.
\%\t"Little Hearth, just over yonder,"\t
                                       she says. She gestures toward planet AB-21, known for its corn crops and absurdly addictove molasses.
\%The Captain turns back to his chili. For the next few minutes he and the woman are silent. Then he asks her if he can buy her a drink.
\%\t"No, I don't drink,"\t
                         she says.
The Captain asks if he can buy her a soda pop instead. She laughs and says alright.

*GotCereal
The Captain takes quick spoonfuls of his cereal. 
*
The enforcers are far off, but he is too unintelligent to sense that. Humans don't come with hyper-sensitive radio receptors like you.
\%\t"Alright now, ma'am, I better be off, but I truly enjoyed your company. I hope I get to see you again sometime."\t
\%The woman locks eyes with the Captain for the first time.
\%\t"I hope so, too," she says.
\t"Oh, you will," thinks the Captain. "you will."

You lower the ship's ramp for the Captain. He walks hesitantly, wishing the woman would join him. 

1) "Captain, remember the enforcers are recorded tracking men relentlessly over decades. Your hopes of settling are limited."
2) "Captain, remember the other women who've joined you."
3) Say nothing.
